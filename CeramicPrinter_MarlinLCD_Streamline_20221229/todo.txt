Steps to do
	-install board
	-make printrun connection
	-test autohome (to confirm endstops)
	
	either-or
		update measurements #define
			1) -	#define DELTA_DIAGONAL_ROD
			2) -	#define DELTA_SMOOTH_ROD_OFFSET
			3) -	#define DELTA_EFFECTOR_OFFSET
			4) - 	#define DELTA_CARRIAGE_OFFSET
			5)	#define DELTA_RADIUS (DELTA_SMOOTH_ROD_OFFSET-DELTA_EFFECTOR_OFFSET-DELTA_CARRIAGE_OFFSET)
			
					**RESULTS**
						1) the MANUAL_Z_HOME_POS was adjusted up 76mm to 432.2; 432.7 would be more accurate but is not required at this time.
						2) The calibration is off... there is a crown in the horizontal motion, where the tool tip touches the bed when approaching a 30-40mm radius (from bed center)
					
			
			6)	*if there are X,Y limits, modify:
					#define X_MAX_POS 101
					#define X_MIN_POS
					#define Y_MAX_POS 100
					#define Y_MIN_POS -100
			7) - 	#define MANUAL_Z_HOME_POS
			
		test flask-socketio
			1) 	connection, baud rate (windows/mac)
			2) 	run file
	
						**RESULTS**
						1) the software seems to work ok.
						2) there is a retract move when the layer completes (and +Z motion occurs)... this should be removed from the GCode generator.
						3) I suspect that the extrusion multiplier range may need to be increased; but it is impossible to confirm until clay is extruded.
