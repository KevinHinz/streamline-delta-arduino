Some basic information

The Arduino used in Streamline-2022 is a fake and a programmer must be used to upload sketches to the board.
The steps are as follows:
1. Connect the programmer to the CPU where the AVRISP mk2 is connected to the cpu and the arduino board is powered with its 5v USB. 
- if everything is correctly configured, the light on the programmer will light up green
2. In the Arduino IDE:
- Check the serial port as you normally would.
- Select **Tools** > **Board** > **Aurduino Mega or Mega 2560** and **Tools** > **Programmer** > **AVRISP mkII** to choose the correct board and programmer.
- Install the mk2 driver if needed; the instructions for a Windows computer are below.
3. **Sketch** > **Upload Using Programmer (CTRL+SHIFT+U)** to upload your sketch
- The IDE will give a progress bar for compiling and uploading
- The exterior light on the programmer will switch to orange and the interior light will flash green
- the the process is complete, both lights on the programmer wil stay green and the progress bar will say "Done uploading."



The windows driver for the AVRISP MK2 can be [found here]>(https://www.olimex.com/Products/AVR/Programmers/AVR-ISP-MK2/resources/DRIVER-MK2-AS-6-7-W10.zip), and instructions on the installation are [here](https://www.olimex.com/forum/index.php?topic=5975.0):

    How to manually install the drivers, over the automatically installed ones or Jungo ones:

    1.1 Make sure that you have downloaded and extracted the drivers provided for AVR-ISP-MK2, available here:

    https://www.olimex.com/Products/AVR/Programmers/AVR-ISP-MK2/resources/DRIVER-MK2-AS-6-7-W10.zip

    1.2. Connect AVR-ISP-MK2 to the personal computer.
    1.3. You should now have some entry for it in "Windows Device Manager". If you can't identify the entry unplug and re-plug the AVR-ISP-MK2 until you are sure. It might be good idea to uninstall any drivers related to the tool, but in most cases if you do everything correctly this shouldn't matter.
    1.4. Right-click over the entry for the cable.
    1.5. Select "Update Driver Software".
    1.6. Select "Browse my computer for driver software".
    1.7. Select the bottom option "Let me pick from a list of drivers on my computer".
    1.8. Click "Have Disk" and point to the place where you extracted the drivers from the archive and select "AVRISP_mkII.inf" then click "Open".
    1.9. Select "Next", and if a warning pops up select "Install Anyway" and after installation close the window.
    1.10. Inspect the new entry in "Windows Device Manager" after the driver installation and ensure that there are no errors or warnings.
    1.11. Test again.
